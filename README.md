1. Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. 
3. Deliverable 3: A written report for PyBer analysis (README.md)

### Pyber Summary

The analysis of the ride sharing data shows that:
- Urban cities generate the most ride activity and total fares by far over Rural cities and about double Suburban cities. 
- Urban cities have way more drivers than Rural and Suburban cities. 
- Rural cities generate the highest per average fares but generate much less ride activity and total fares. 
- Suburban cities are the middle when it comes ride activity and total fares. generate more five times the fares than Rural 
- Suburban cities do however, have 38% of the ride activity as Urban cities but generate about 50% in fares of what Urban cities do. 
- When it comes to volatility in fare per ride, Urban and Suburban are steadier than Rural rides which can be a bit more volatile.

*data is for January through April in 2019.*

The analysis for the total fare by city type shows that:

- Urban cities see an increase in fares starting in mid January that continue through April.
- Suburban cities see an increase in fares starting in mid January with boosts in early March and May.
