# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview:

Analyze and visualize PyBer 2019 ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, to help the company improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

### Project Challenge:
*Create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type for V.Isualize.  The challenge consists of two technical analysis delieverables and a written report of the results.*

1. Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. 
3. Deliverable 3: A written report for PyBer analysis (README.md)

### Project Resources

- Data Source: 
    - Pyber_Challenge_starter_code
    - city_data.csv
    - ride_data.csv
    
- Software: Anaconda Version 3.7.3, MacOS Catalina Version 10.15.7, Jupyter Notebook

## Project Results:

Analysis of the Pyber Summary data show that:
- Urban cities generate the most ride activity and total fares by far over Rural cities and about double Suburban cities. 
- Urban cities have way more drivers than Rural and Suburban cities. 
- Rural cities generate the highest per average fares but generate much less ride activity and total fares. 
- Suburban cities are the middle when it comes ride activity and total fares. generate more five times the fares than Rural 
- Suburban cities do however, have 38% of the ride activity as Urban cities but generate about 50% in fares of what Urban cities do. 
- When it comes to volatility in fare per ride, Urban and Suburban are steadier than Rural rides which can be a bit more volatile. 

### Total Fares by City Type

*data is for January through April in 2019.*

The analysis for the total fare by city type shows that:
- Fares generated in January through April are at it's lowest in January for Rural, Suburban and Urban cities. 
- In the mid to late Februarym, fares saw a spike up for Rural, Suburban, and Urban cities. 
- Urban cities see an increase in fares starting in mid January that continue through April.
- Suburban cities see an increase in fares starting in mid January with boosts in early March and May.
- Rural cities experienced more fare volaltiliy than Urban and Suburban with two spikes up in mid February and mid April. 

## Project Summary:
By looking at the data it is pretty easy to see that the highest ride activity and total fares are being generated in the urban cities. Urban cities generally have constant activity so they are nice and continuous revenue generators. However, their average fare per ride and per driver was lower than the other two cities types.  This was probably due to a lot more shorter ride times. 

That does not mean that Rural and Suburban cities should be forgotten about.  Suburban cities had a nice steady inflow of fares generated. They did see two nice spikes in the middle of February and beginning of April.  This increase in activity in the Suburbs could be do to the fact that the people are traveling more for spring and summer vacations. Rural cities can get pretty slow at times but they too saw increases in late February and early April.  Rural cities have the highest average per ride fares and averager per driver fares. 

## Project Recommendations:
1. Increase or create a minimum rider fare for Urban cities to increase average ride fare and generate more revenue.  
2. Send a few more drivers out to the Suburban cities during peak vacation times (i.e. Spring Break, Holdidays, beginning of summer).
3. Increase fares in Suburban citites during peak vaction times and lower them when demands drops.
